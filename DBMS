Ques 1: What is DBMS ?
Ans : Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of
    programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. 
    In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.
   
   It can be used for:- 
      Creation of a database.
      Retrieval of information from the database.
      Updating the database.
      Managing a database.
      
      
      
Ques 2:   What us VIEW in dbms ?
Ans : - Views in SQL are considered as a virtual table. A view also contains rows and columns.
        To create the view, we can select the fields from one or more tables present in the database.
        A view can either have specific rows based on certain condition or all the rows of a table.
      
      Syntax:
          CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2..... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
          SELECT * FROM table ;
          

Que 3 :-what is  Normalization ?
Ans :-  1) Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
        2) Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics
          like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
        3) Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.
        4) The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.
        
        Normal Form	        Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          1NF	         |       A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
          2NF          |      	A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
          3NF          |     	A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
          4NF          |   	A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
          5NF          |     	A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.
          
 
 
Ques 4: Deletion of duplicate row in table ?
Ans :  1)  SELECT 
                [FirstName], [LastName], [Country], COUNT(*) AS CNT 
                FROM EMployee_table
                GROUP BY [FirstName],  [LastName], [Country] 
                HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
                
        2)    SELECT *
                FROM EMployee_table
                WHERE ID NOT IN
                (
                    SELECT MAX(ID)
                    FROM EMployee_table
                    GROUP BY [FirstName], 
                             [LastName], 
                             [Country]
                );
                
                
Ques 5: copy all date 1 table into another table ?
Ans :  INSERT INTO table2 SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE condition;

Ques 6: What is a Stored Procedure?
Ans :  A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
      So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it
      
      Stored Procedure Syntax:
          CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name  AS  sql_statement GO;
          
      Execute a Stored Procedure :
          EXEC procedure_name ;
          
      Example  :
          CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10) AS SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode GO;
          EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';
          
     
Ques 7 : Create duplicate table with or without data ?
Ans :      without data:
                CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;
              
           With data :
                1) CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;                  // Creating an Empty Table
                    INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;      // Inserting Data into Table
                2)  CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;   // simple cloning
                
Ques 8: Fetch even and odd record in table ?
Ans :  -->   SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE  WHERE id IN ( SELECT id FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE id%2 = 0 );     // even data
        -->  SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE  WHERE id IN(SELECT id FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE id%2 <> 0);        // odd data

Ques 9: What is case study in DBMS?
Ans: Patients having different kinds of ailments come to the hospital and get checkup done from the concerned doctors. ... 
    The aim of this case study is to design and develop a database for the hospital to maintain the records of various departments, rooms, and doctors in the hospital.

        
Ques 10:  fetch last row in table ?
Ans :- select *from getLastRecord ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;

Ques 11 : What is Group by Clause ?
Ans : The SQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups. This GROUP BY clause follows the 
        WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.
        
        SELECT column1, column2FROM table_name WHERE [ conditions ] GROUP BY column1, column2 ORDER BY column1, column2.
        
Ques 12 : What is INDEX ? 
Ans : The INDEX is used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly. An Index can be created by using a single or group of columns in a table. 
        When the index is created, it is assigned a ROWID for each row before it sorts out the data.
        
        CREATE INDEX index_name  ON table_name ( column1, column2.....);
        
Ques 13 : What is HAVING Clause ?
Ans : The HAVING Clause enables you to specify conditions that filter which group results appear in the results.
        The WHERE clause places conditions on the selected columns, whereas the HAVING clause places conditions on groups created by the GROUP BY clause.
        
        SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1, table2 WHERE [ conditions ] GROUP BY column1, column2 HAVING [ conditions ] ORDER BY column1, column2 .
        
Ques 14: find the 2nd highes and Nth highest salary ?
Ans :   1)  SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN ( SELECT Max(Salary) FROM Employee);
        2)  SELECT MAX(Salary) From Employee WHERE Salary < ( SELECT Max(Salary) FROM Employee);
        3)  SELECT name, MAX(salary) AS salary FROM employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary)  FROM employee);
        4)  SELECT Id, Salary FROM Employee e WHERE 2=(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee p WHERE e.Salary<=p.Salary)
        5)  SELECT name, salary FROM employee A WHERE n-1 = (SELECT count(1)  FROM employee B  WHERE B.salary>A.salary)
